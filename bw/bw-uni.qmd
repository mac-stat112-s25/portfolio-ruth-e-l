title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# import data
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
hikes <- read_csv("C:/Users/ruthe/Downloads/high_peaks.csv")

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of the elevations of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks. Source: C:/Users/ruthe/Downloads/high_peaks.csv"
#| fig-alt: "Density plot of the elevations of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks, where the elevations range from 3820 feet to 5344 feet, and most commonly fall between 4000 and 4250.Source: C:/Users/ruthe/Downloads/high_peaks.csv"

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(fill = "darkolivegreen3", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Density") + theme_minimal()

```
